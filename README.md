# DOM-Projects

This repository contains several small JavaScript projects that focus on DOM manipulation and interactivity. Each project demonstrates different features of JavaScript and HTML to create interactive web applications. These projects are designed to help you learn and practice working with the DOM in a fun and engaging way.

## Projects

### Project 1: Background Color Changer

This project allows users to change the background color of the webpage by clicking on different color options. When a user clicks a color, the background of the page dynamically updates to reflect that color. This demonstrates handling user input through event listeners and manipulating styles via JavaScript.

### Project 2: BMI Calculator

In this project, users can calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) by inputting their height and weight into a form. The result is displayed with feedback based on the BMI value. If the BMI is outside the healthy range, the result text is colored red; otherwise, it is shown in greenish-yellow. This project demonstrates form handling, validation, and conditional styling.

### Project 3: Live Clock

This project updates and displays the current time on a button element, updating every second. The time is shown in the format of hours, minutes, and seconds, and it automatically adjusts based on the user's local time. This project showcases working with the `setInterval` function and dynamically updating the DOM.

### Project 4: Number Guessing Game

A fun number guessing game where users try to guess a random number between 1 and 100. The player has 10 attempts to guess the number, with hints provided after each guess (whether the guess is too high or too low). The game ends either when the correct number is guessed or when the player runs out of attempts. This project highlights user input handling, conditional logic, and dynamic updates to the interface.

### Project 5: Random Background Color Generator

This project continuously changes the background color of the webpage to a random color every second, using a hex color code. The color generation starts when the "Start" button is clicked and can be stopped by clicking the "Stop" button. This demonstrates the use of JavaScript's `setInterval`, DOM manipulation, and event handling.
